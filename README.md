# Drink'em John
Drink'em John is a unique and slightly absurd 3D game set in the gritty, slow-paced streets of Kouvola, Finland. You take on the role of John - a man of few words, fewer ambitions, and an impressive tolerance for beer. John spends his days planted at a weathered bus stop, faithfully drinking one can after another as cars pass by on the nearby road.  But this isn't just a passive drinking experience. Every empty bottle becomes an opportunity. If a passing car happens to have its window down, John can attempt to hurl the bottle into the vehicle. Itâ€™s all about timing, aim, and dealing with the increasing challenge of coordination as John becomes more intoxicated.
