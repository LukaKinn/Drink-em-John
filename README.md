# Drink'em John
Drink'em John is a 3D drinking and bottle-throwing simulator being developed in Unity.
Set in the quiet town of Kouvola, Finland, you play as John — a man who spends his days drinking beer at a bus stop and hurling empty bottles into passing cars. It's a strange, chaotic, and somewhat tragic concept, still in the works.

## Gameplay Overview
You sit. You drink. You throw.

The concept is simple: after finishing a beer, you try to toss the empty bottle into a passing car — only if the car’s window is open. But as John drinks more, it becomes increasingly difficult to aim and throw, with blurry vision, sluggish controls, and a wobbling aim.

## Features (Planned)  
- Stylized 3D graphics using Unity
- Physics-based bottle throwing mechanics
- Progressive difficulty with each drink
- A reactive environment with random car spawns
- A moody, lo-fi aesthetic inspired by Finnish small-town life

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   Run the following command in your terminal or Git client:
   `git clone https://github.com/LukaKinn/Drink-em-John.git`

2. Open the project in Unity:
   This project was created using Unity 6 (6000.0.37f1) LTS.
   Open the project folder with Unity Hub or directly in the Unity Editor.

3. Play the game (currently a work in progress):
   Open the game scene located at `Scenes/Game.unity` and press the Play button in the editor.
   *Note: The game is still in development, so some mechanics may not be functional yet.*

## Controls (Planned)
- Drink Beer - Left Mouse Click
- Throw Bottle - Right Mouse Click
- Look Around - Mouse Movement
- Quit Game - Escape

*Note: Control scheme is currently optimized for PC mouse input.*

## Development Status
This game is still in very early development. The core mechanics and features are in the planning stages, with much more to come.

Planned additions include:
- Full bottle throwing mechanics with physics interaction
- Increasing difficulty as John drinks more
- Score system and leaderboard
- Environmental changes (weather, time-of-day cycles)
- More character animations and visual effects
- Sound effects and UI elements

## Acknowledgments
Inspired by the surreal energy of small-town life in Finland, lo-fi games, and the idea that even the most bizarre game concepts deserve a shot at development.

Made with beer and questionable life choices.
